    "text": "Text\nI saw Y. on the 31st. She stayed for about an hour and told me of her hopes: she sees the possibility of a sort of world television (I don’t know how that would be arranged), with a telephone, and there would be a central office with a collection of answers to all possible questions—each question answered by someone eminent or qualified. The result would be the organization of a universal education—well, terrestrial—that would really be an education for all countries, in which the knowledge and best qualities of every country in the artistic, literary and scientific fields would be gathered in a kind of transmitting centre, and all you would have to do would be to get into communication with it. So then, instead of having more or less incapable teachers to teach what they also know more or less, you would have the answer to every question, the most competent and best answer. Thus there would really be all over the earth an education that would be the best possible, from which everyone would receive only what he wants; you wouldn’t have to attend classes, a number of useless classes, in order to catch the little you want to know: you would have it just by getting into communication with the centre; you would ask for such and such a number and would get your answer.\nIf it could be realized, it would be very good. It means that the most beautiful works of art, the most beautiful teachings, all the best of what humanity is GOING to produce, would be collected and within reach of all those who had a television. There would be the image along with the explanation, or the text or speech. A kind of imposing central building where everything would be gathered. I found it rather attractive. I told her that we would have that in Auroville (not the central office: just a receiving set). She said that instead of teachers who teach poorly what they know, there would be the best teaching on each subject…. (I didn’t ask her WHO would select those people—that remains the somewhat delicate point.) But I found the idea very attractive. She said things are moving in that direction.",

But what follows this is an interesting exchange between Satprem and the Mother which discusses the utility of the “world television” as opposed to the intuitive way of learning. The Mother initially comments that the latter is more difficult but then quickly adds these comments at the end:\n\nI listened to what she said and simply found it was better than recruiting incompetent teachers.\nBut there still remained a doubt (which I didn’t discuss) on the quality of the CHOICE of answers. Whereas if you go there, to the Origin, then you’re sure!\nThat’s what they are now trying to do here in their new classes: teaching them to make contact with the intuitive zone.\nIt’s certainly quite superior.",
